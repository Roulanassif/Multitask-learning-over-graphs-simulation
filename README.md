# Multitask-learning-over-graphs-simulation
Code examples to accompany the tutorial "T-12: Federated and Decentralized Multitask Learning" by Stefan Vlaski, Roula Nassif and Ali H. Sayed at IEEE ICASSP 2022.

Code is provided in Jupyter notebooks in ```gmrf.ipynb``` to reproduce simulations around Gaussian Markov Random Fields in Part II, as well as ```multitask.ipynb``` to reproduce some of the multitask concepts described in Part III.
